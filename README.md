In this project, we aim to make education a little more accessable to those who desire and need it, but may not make the sufficient means to aquire it.

We have made a website in which people can volunteer to teach those people/students who want to learn.

As a user:
  - You register either as a student or a tutor-volunteer, then(as a tutor-volunteer) you specify what exactly can you teach (eg. python programing, basic english, 12th class maths etc.)
  - Then, the website lists all the tutors based on what they teach, and provides the user (either student/tutor) to see the contact information if they want to get in touch with the volunteer (and request them to teach).

This will be very useful in bridging the gap between the people who can't study, and the people who have an abundance of academic resources at thier disposal.

Furthermore, this project can easily be extended beyond the scope of volunteered-teaching, by incorporating different kinds of volunteership for various NGOs etc.
for eg:
  - People can come together and volunteer to clean up some neighbourhood.
  - Different NGOs can post thier requirements for volunteers, and interested users can volunteer to help the NGO.
  
        
        
This extention can prove to be a huge help for small, local,  relatively unknown and/or underfunded NGOs and social causes, by providing them with a platform to reach the ones that want to help out the world in thier own small way, and make a postivie impact.
